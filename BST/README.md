Problem statement
=================

In this problem, you will write the delete member function to delete a node from a BST. Recall that to delete a node from a BST you need to consider the three cases that we discussed in class.

a. The node has no children
b. The node has only one child
c. The node has two children

As an example consider the following BST. You need to create this BST by inserting these elements from the treetester.cpp file.

Delete nodes 13, 10 and 3 in order. Every time you delete a node, use the inorder() member function you wrote to show that the BST property is being maintained. 

Inorder() will print out the elements of a BST in sorted order. Test your code with other BSTs to see if the delete member function is working correctly.
